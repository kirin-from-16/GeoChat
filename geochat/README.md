# GeoChat-7B

GeoChat is the first grounded Large Vision Language Model, specifically tailored to Remote Sensing(RS) scenarios. Unlike general-domain models, GeoChat excels in handling high-resolution RS imagery, employing region-level reasoning for comprehensive scene interpretation. Leveraging a newly created RS multimodal dataset, GeoChat is fine-tuned using the LLaVA-1.5 architecture. This results in robust zero-shot performance across various RS tasks, including image and region captioning, visual question answering, scene classification, visually grounded conversations, and referring object detection.
